# Moonlight-Calculator
Love Calculator but with a twist.
Made using:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Firebase Database

# How to Use
<ol>
  <li> Go to Firebase Console and Create a new Project </li>
  <li> Then create a REALTIME DATABASE </li>
  <li> Fill the FIREBASE CREDENTIALS in your config.js </li>
</ol>


That's all!
Whatever anyone writes in the input box will be sent to your FIREBASE REALTIME DATABASE. <br>
You can see what what names were written along with the percentage, and Date and time. Just Check your FIREBASE REALTIME DATABASE.
